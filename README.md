# Ubuntu 18.04 with Node 8.x (Carbon)

Just an extremely basic image based on the Official Ubuntu image for 18.04.

## Highlights
Adds the following:
  - curl
  - git
  - node 8.x (Carbon)
  - build-essential
    - Okay, so build-essential isn't really needed but it does add all that extra code building goodness (think C++ stuff!) that you might want to access using node.
